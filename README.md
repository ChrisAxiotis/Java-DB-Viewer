# java_db_viewer

Java program that connects to a database and views all Schemas and Tables using Java Swing for the GUI.
This project was made for practice.

Built with Java 8.

In the connection menu just add the IP of the connection. The program adds to the url the "jdbc:mysql://" part automatically. Also there is no need to define a Schema from the begining because the program will pull all available Schemas when the connection starts.

Example: If you want to connect to "jdbc:mysql://localhost/mySchema" in the connection menu just type "localhost" in the url part.

Version 0.1

This project is still under development.
